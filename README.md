# About JStrings

__JStrings__ are an extension of the [String Resources][apple-strings-url]
format used inside Apple developments.
This format is usefull during localisation process, human readable, and easy to shared.
The _Apple Strings Resources_ is in text format and contains pairs of key-value that are `strings`.
Comments can be sets inside the text file.

```bash
/* A one line comment */
"My first key"="My first value";

/*
 *  A multi-lines comment
 *
 */
"My second key"="My second value";
 
```

> The file format is very simple !

Composed with the filename itself, followed by optinals underscore and ISO code,
terminated by the extension.
```bash
filename[_iso].extension

// Default file
common.jstrings.txt
// English localised file
common_en.jstrings.txt
// French localised file
common_fr.jstrings.txt
...etc
```

> ISO code's format and extensions are whatever you'd like _(See : ISO 639)_.
>
> The default file is used when no localised file according to a code were found.

The __JStrings__ introduces multi-lines values.
It used a specifics values format, surrounded by brackets.
The output result will be joined by a newline.

```bash
/* A multi-lines values */
"My 1st line..."=["My 1st line","followed by a 2nd line","","Ended by a 4th line"];
```

It's up to you to define the key you'd like to use.
It must be unique along the files you're using.
Best practive is to be verbose in your code.

You'd like to add some variables in your string, for example, like this :
```javascript
    "Welcome %1 ! Rock\'n\'Roll !".localize().replace('%1',user.name);
```

There's no specific format for the variables.
You can use any caracters you'd like at your own risk.
By the way, you can combine strings together.

# Usage

## With Node.js
```javascript
"use strict";

const Localization    = require("Localization");

const languages       = ["de","en","es","he","fr"];
let   lang            = "en";

Localization.language( languages, lang );

Localization.load("strings/common.jstrings.txt");
Localization.load("strings/myapp.jstrings.txt");

console.log( "Hello world !".localize() );
```

## In a browser
```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jq/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/lib/Localization.cls.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var languages       = ["de","en","es","he","fr"];
        var lang            = "en";

        var page            = "welcome.html";

        Localization.language( languages, lang );

        lang = /fr/.test(navigator.language) ? 'fr' : 'en'; //Force 'fr' if ok 
        Localization.localize( lang );

        if( ! Localization.load("strings/common.jstrings.txt") )
            console.log("Localization common FAILED !");
            
        if( ! Localization.load("strings/myapp.jstrings.txt")  )
            console.log("Localization myapp  FAILED !");

        splash( "Hello world !".localize() );
        
        $("#content").load("inc/" + page.localize());
    </script>
```

# Localization class

You don't need to instanciate it.
